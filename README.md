# MedicalTechnologyProject

Above is the code for my R Shiny App that allowed patients to put in their information and get their risk estimate for revision knee surgery and other post-operation complications. After combing through over 400+ data tables in the Bonutti Technology Databased, we utilized Random Forest to get a prediction for post-op knee surgery issues utilizing data on demographics, personal medical information, and family history.  The project received second place in the Analytical Consulting Competition ($300) and we were awarded the Top Presentation Award ($100).
